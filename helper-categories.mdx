# 🗂️ Helper Categories

**Helper Categories** allow you to group your chat helpers under specific categories for better organization and easy access. By creating categories, you can manage different types of helpers more efficiently, whether it's for specific use cases or industries. Once a category is created, it will be added to all helper categories, making it easy to organize and manage your chatbots.

## 🔧 Manage Chat Categories

You can manage your chat helpers by categorizing them. This helps you keep all the helpers organized and ensures that users can easily find the chatbot they need for a specific use case.

### How It Works

1. **Add a New Category**: 
   - You can create a new chat category by clicking the **Add Category** button. Once you add a category, it will be available for use in all helper categories.
   - **Category Name**: Provide a name for the category (e.g., "Customer Support", "Finance Expert").
   - **Action**: Manage the actions for each category, such as renaming or deleting.

2. **Categories for Helpers**:
   - Once a category is created, all chat helpers within that category will be organized under it. For example, if you create a "Finance Expert" category, you can then add finance-related chat helpers to that category.
