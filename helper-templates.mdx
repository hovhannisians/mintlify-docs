**Helper Templates** are pre-built frameworks that help you create custom chatbots for different use cases. By creating templates, you can easily deploy specialized chatbots, which will then interact with users based on predefined responses and behaviors. To use these templates, you first need to train the chatbot with relevant data.

Before creating a template, you must first **train your chatbot** using relevant data. You can select a trained chatbot from the list under **Select Chatbot** or come back anytime to update the chatbot.

1. **Select Chatbot**: Choose the chatbot that you've previously trained.
2. **Select Assistant**: Choose the AI assistant that you want the chatbot to use. This assistant will be responsible for generating responses based on the trained data.

### Chatbot Training Notes:
- **Train First**: You need to train your chatbot with appropriate data and instructions before applying a template. Once trained, you can always update the chatbot later to fine-tune its responses.
